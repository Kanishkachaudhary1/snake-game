# Snake Game using Pygame

This is a classic Snake Game built using the Pygame library in Python. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food, growing longer with each bite. The game includes features such as:

* User Controls: Arrow keys to move the snake in all directions.
* Food Mechanics: Randomly appearing food increases score and snake length.
* High Score Tracking: Stores and displays the highest score achieved using a text file.
* Sound Effects: Background music and a beep sound when food is eaten.
* Graphics: Custom background images for the start screen, gameplay, and game over.
* Game Over Detection: Ends the game when the snake collides with itself or the screen edges.

This project demonstrates the use of Pygame for 2D game development, including event handling, collision detection, rendering images and text, and playing sounds.
